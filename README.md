# Task1
In Task 1 of the AI & ML internship, the objective was to perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The process began with loading the dataset and exploring its structure, including identifying null values and data types. Missing data was handled by imputing numerical values like "Age" with the median and categorical values like "Embarked" with the mode. Categorical features such as "Sex" and "Embarked" were converted into numerical form using label encoding. Numerical features like "Age" and "Fare" were then standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across features
